Wildfire believes in the collective growth of our community through and with each individual. It is through the community that diversity, inclusivity and leadership become elemental and each voice is heard. We welcome contributions as well as criticism which enables every one of us to create their own space and move towards an empowering environment. At the same time, we do understand the responsibility and accountability that comes with being part of such spaces. Hence, to make sure that we co-create a safe environment for each member of the community we have certain guidelines which we expect each member to adhere to.

Here’s to an inspiring and exciting learning experience for all!

## Expected Behaviour
Following is the behaviour expected of each community member.

### Accountability
Each one of us comes from a different walk of life which along with diversity, also brings in the opportunity to learn from each others’ experiences and sharing. While we contribute and/or constructively critique, we will be accountable for our words, actions and our work. Our work speaks for us, and the way we engage with the community is a reflection of us.

### Co-creating a Learning Environment
Seek and ye shall receive! We shall seek to create an environment which helps us to grow but at the same time, be there to enable another person’s growth too. This can be done by sharing ideas, by being there to listen to another community member if they reach out to you or at times, by being silent while they figure things out for themselves. Encourage all voices to be heard.
 
### Be Respectful
Everyone has their own boundaries. But as we guard ours, we shall listen, value and respect each person’s opinion, feelings and sharing. Be open to different types and mediums of communication and work styles. If at any time you are invading some’s space or being disrespectful, be aware of your behaviour and apologise. We’re in this together after all. Through your time with the community, you might be part of debates and conversations. Through each of those, try to be sensitive towards others’ view points and assess the impact of your intentions. The community puts their trust in you.

### Inclusivity
Listen, include and give space for each voice, being and work. Over the years, each of us develop our own understanding of the world around us, of our own selves as well as our working style. Valuing your style, make sure to understand and accommodate others’ way too. If you disagree with someone, ask questions to know where they are coming from. At the same time, make space for people to be able to ask questions to you too. If you see someone being uncomfortable with the language being used around or with them, ask them about it, talk. And if needed in the moment, step up. Remember it is not about someone losing or winning a debate, but about everyone being able to participate.

## Unexpected Behaviour

### Discrimination
We are individual beings with our own set of uniquenesses. But acting against another on the basis of caste, gender, family, background, sexual preferences, age, religion or ideology is neither accepted nor tolerated. If you do hurt someone, knowingly, unknowingly or with no such intention to do so, apologise. Try to understand why did it hurt them. Be accommodating of another’s words and most of all, be sensitive.

### Violence or Violent Communication
Raising voices or attempting or doing physical harm in any way is not acceptable within or outside of the workspace. Any instigation of violence, inappropriate commenting or misbehaviour will not be tolerated online or offline.

### Unwanted physical contact
What might be casual or unharmful touch for you, might be a cross over of physical boundaries for someone else. If you are doubtful at any point, ask for consent. This would include touching someone on the shoulder, arm, any sensitive area, a tattoo, head or hair. Simply asking would go a long way and create a space of safety and security for each community member. In case someone crosses a physical boundary and you do not feel okay or safe, please reach out to a trusting person and share. If you do feel okay, call it out on the spot.

## Consequences
Unexpected behaviour, from anyone in the team or community, will have consequences. These shall include verbal warning, temporary or permanent termination from the team and/or community.

In a situation when a person expresses their discomfort, the other person is expected to comply immediately.

## Legal Compliance
Following the The Sexual Harassment Act, 2013, we have made an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC), and decided on it's processes for making a complaint and inquiring into the complaint in a time bound manner.

Handbook on Sexual Harassment - https://slack-files.com/TSG69FMD5-F011WEDTV17-cac9c5937a

In addition to ensuring compliance, the law recommends the following for Employers:
-   provide a safe working environment
-   display conspicuously at the workplace, the penal consequences of indulging in acts that may constitute sexual harassment and the composition of the ICC
-   organise workshops and awareness programmes at regular intervals for sensitizing employees on the issues and implications of workplace sexual harassment and organizing orientation programmes for members of the ICC
-   treat sexual harassment as a misconduct under the service rules and initiate action for misconduct
-   the employer is also required to monitor the timely submission of reports by the ICC.

At Wildfire, we encourage questions regarding the guidelines and/or in general. If you have an questions or suggestions, do reach out to us.
